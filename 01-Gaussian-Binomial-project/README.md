# 01 - Gaussian Binomial Project

This is the first project of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. Initially, the lessons consisted of fundamental software practices and then ventured into creating this Gaussian and binomial project (supervised)

This PyPi package allows users to calculate and visualise Gaussian distributions and Binomial Distributions.

## Installation

This is a working Python package that is currently uploaded to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Gaussian-binomial-ML/)

This projects requires **Python3** and **Matplotlib** installed on your local machine

This package can be pip installed with the command:

```
pip install Gaussian-binomial-ML
```

### Disclaimer:

This project is coded by the Udacity Machine Learning team and is only used to demonstrate skills I have learned and the ability to upload and import a Python package to PyPi.
